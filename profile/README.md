## Medizinische Informatik - Klinik für Anästhesie, Universitätsmedizin Greifswald

Welcome to the GitHub page of the Medizinische Informatik working group at the Klinik für Anästhesie, Universitätsmedizin Greifswald. Our group focuses on the development and implementation of decision support systems in medicine.

## Goal

Our primary objective is to research and develop Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). These systems offer crucial, processed information to clinical staff at the point of care, aiding in specific decision-making. Our group works on both knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based CDSS, emphasizing the importance of seamlessly integrating these systems into clinical treatment processes and enhancing their usability.

## Key Areas of Focus

- Standardization and interoperability of computer-interpretable clinical guideline recommendations.
- Development of machine learning-based prediction models for clinical events as a basis for non-knowledge-based CDSS.
- Usability-optimized visualization of decision-support information for clinical staff.

## Team

- Dr. rer. nat. Gregor Lichtner

## Projects

- **CELIDA**: Automated integration of clinical guideline recommendations with patient data.
- **PREEVENT-ICU**: Machine learning-supported prediction of clinical events based on routine data in intensive care. This project aims to develop prediction models for clinically relevant events using supervised machine learning methods like gradient boosting, support vector machines, neural networks, and Gaussian process regression.
